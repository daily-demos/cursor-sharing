            <h2>The Raven</h2>
            <h3>By Edgar Allan Poe</h3>
            <p>
              Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
              <br>Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
              <br>While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
              <br>As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—
              <br>“’Tis some visiter,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
              <br><span class="indent">Only this and nothing more.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
              <br>And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
              <br>Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
              <br>From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
              <br>For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
              <br><span class="indent">Nameless <i>here</i> for evermore.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
              <br>Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
              <br>So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
              <br>“’Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door—
              <br>Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;—
              <br><span class="indent">This it is and nothing more.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
              <br>”Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
              <br>But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
              <br>And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
              <br>That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—
              <br><span class="indent">Darkness there and nothing more.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
              <br>Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
              <br>But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
              <br>And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”
              <br>This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”
              <br><span class="indent">Merely this and nothing more.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
              <br>Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
              <br>“Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;
              <br>Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
              <br>Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—
              <br><span class="indent">’Tis the wind and nothing more!”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
              <br>In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
              <br>Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
              <br>But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
              <br>Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
              <br><span class="indent">Perched, and sat, and nothing more.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
              <br>By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
              <br>“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
              <br>Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
              <br>Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
              <br><span class="indent">Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
              <br>Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;
              <br>For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
              <br>Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
              <br>Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
              <br><span class="indent">With such name as “Nevermore.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
              <br>That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
              <br>Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
              <br>Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
              <br>On the morrow <i>he</i> will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
              <br><span class="indent">Then the bird said “Nevermore.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
              <br>“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store
              <br>Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
              <br>Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
              <br>Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
              <br><span class="indent">Of ‘Never—nevermore.’ ”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              But the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
              <br>Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
              <br>Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
              <br>Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
              <br>What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
              <br><span class="indent">Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
              <br>To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;
              <br>This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
              <br>On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,
              <br>But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,
              <br><span class="indent"><i>She</i> shall press, ah, nevermore!</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
              <br>Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
              <br>“Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
              <br>Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
              <br>Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
              <br><span class="indent">Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
              <br>Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
              <br>Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
              <br>On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
              <br>Is there—<i>is</i> there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
              <br><span class="indent">Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
              <br>By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
              <br>Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
              <br>It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
              <br>Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
              <br><span class="indent">Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
              <br>“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
              <br>Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
              <br>Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
              <br>Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
              <br><span class="indent">Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, <i>still</i> is sitting
              <br>On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
              <br>And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
              <br>And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
              <br>And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
              <br><span class="indent">Shall be lifted—nevermore!</span>
