# Daily cursor sharing

A demo showing how cursor sharing features can be implemented with Daily's [`"app-message"`](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/participant-events#app-message) events.

## Prerequisites

- [Sign up for a free Daily account](https://dashboard.daily.co/signup)
- Create a room through your [Daily dashboard](http://dashboard.daily.co) or our [REST API](https://docs.daily.co/reference/rest-api/rooms/create-room)

## How the demo works

The demo opens a [Daily Prebuilt](https://www.daily.co/prebuilt) call on the left hand side of the page and loads some shared reading content on the right hand side. Call participants see each others' cursors and Daily user names as they navigate the content on the right-hand side of the screen.

## Running locally

1. `npm i`
1. `npm run start`
